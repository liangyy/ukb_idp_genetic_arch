Here is a test run of ImageXcan and S-ImageXcan.

The procedure is as follow.

1. Simulate weight for IDP models.
2. Run prediction script to obtain the predicted IDP.
3. Simulate the phenotype by y = IDP[k] + noise.
4. Run ImageXcan.
5. Run GWAS on the phenotype.
6. Compute the genotype covariance.
7. Run S-ImageXcan.
